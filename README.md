Dataset Name: Nomos8k
License: check sources

Purpose: Realistic SR

Description:

Contains 8507 tiles of 512x512px each, and the meta_info file. Nomos8k is meant to be an improvement over the previous. Just like Nomos2k, the purpose of this dataset is to gather as much information about textures and shapes as possible. The original images were tiled to 512px squares and hand selected based on the same criteria used on nomos2k:
High signal-to-noise ratio (low noise)
Diverse.
Sharp (no motion blur, shallow DOF is accepted but undesired)
Contains mixed and complex textures/shapes that cover most part of the image

Additionally, Nomos8k has been enhanced by around ~2.5k tiles of human textures, and ~400 faces selected from the FFHQ dataset.

Raw images were processed on rawtherapee using prebayer deconvolution, AMaZe and AP1 color space. Sources: Adobe-MIT-5k, RAISE, FFHQ, DIV2K, DIV8k, Flickr2k, Rawsamples, SignatureEdits, Hasselblad raw samples and Unsplash.
